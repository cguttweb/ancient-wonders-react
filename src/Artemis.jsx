      <h1>Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, Greece</h1>
        <p>This temple was commissioned by King Croesus of Lydia and took 120 years to build. It was completed in 550BCE and was 129m and 69m wide supported by 127 columns. The magnificence was praised by multiple ancient sources all agreeing that it was the most astounding structure ever built.</p>
        <p>A series of sacred places and sanctuaries were demolished and rebuilt on the same site. The best two sanctuaries built c.550 and 350BBCE the first was designed by Creton architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes constructed probably by the most acclaimed craftsmen of the ancient world.</p>
