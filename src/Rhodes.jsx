      <h1>Colossus of Rhodes</h1>
      <p>This gigantic bronze model of the sun God Helios was built between 292-280BC and stood 33m high. It was commissioned to celebrate Rhodes' victory over the attacking forces of Demetrius in 304BC.</p>
      <p>It was designed by the sculptor Chares and was the tallest statue in the ancient world. It only stood for 56 years before it was wrecked by an earthquake in 226BC.</p>
      <p>Little is known about the appearance or the location of the statue. According to the historian Strabo it lay in ruin for 800 years and when the Arabs attacked Rhodes years later they sold the remaining parts of the statte as scrap metal.</p>
