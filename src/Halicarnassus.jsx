      <h1>Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, Turkey</h1>
      <p>This tomb was built by Artemisia for her husband Mausolus following his death in 353BCE. It was made of white marble and was thought to be 135ft (43m) high and to have included Lycian, Egyptian and Greek design styles.</p>
      <p>The first layer had steps with 60ft base with the central layer having 36 sections and pyramid shaped roof. At the peack of the roof was the tomb and a marble chariot with 4 horses each of them 20 feet long and were crafted by 4 stonemasons.</p>
      <p>It was destroyed by a series of earthquakes and lay in ruins until 1494 when it was cleared and used by knights of St John of Malta as the stronghold of Bodrum.</p>
