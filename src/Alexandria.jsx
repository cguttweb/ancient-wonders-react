      <h1>Lighthouse of Alexandria</h1>
      <p>The famous lighthouse at Alexandria was situated on the island of Pharos close to the city. It was built by the Greek engineer Sostratus and was finished in c.280BCE. It was used to guide ships down the Nile. It was extensively damaged by numerous earthquakes in 956, 1303 and 1323.</p>
      <p>By 1480 it was gone but some pieces of the original have been found at the bottom of the Nile.</p>
